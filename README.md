# hello-world
My public repository... I have no idea for what it is, because I'm beginner in github. Therefore, I don't know what I am doing here exactly. Right now I don't have any my project which I have already shared with someone.
So, I'm working with my own project to create a big math-library for solution of the some important problems of the physics solid state. And I'm talking about some serious functions which should be destined to be solutions of the some little bit more problems than common additions or multiplying.
First part of the library is dedicated to the vectors and matrices that built over the field of the real numbers. Also here we can see some applications of these things, like linear equations, tensor properties of the matter, etc.
Second part of the library is for working with the complex numbers. There some important operations over complex numbers and complex vectors will be found, from algebraic operations to description of rotation operations using quaternions.
Third part... Well, in my head I have any more than two parts, but right now it is quite early to talk about that.
Oh, and what am I thinking about?.. I work in C# for the .NET platform.
Oh, yes, one more thing ... Like all people, I sometimes eat and drink beer)) Therefore, if someone has freelance tasks for writing code in Visual Basic for Access, PHP, My(SQL), C# I will be happy to help for a small reward.
